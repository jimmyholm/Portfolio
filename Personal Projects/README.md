The personal projects folder contain a couple of snippets from projects I have worked on in my spare time.

Most of my personal work involves non-project related coding, simply writing and rewriting old code to keep myself
up to date with new standards and trying out new small programming tasks.

Avalanche contains the unfinished code of a Tetris clone, written back in 2013. This was an attempt at familiarising myself with the
SFML API and working with a more strict object oriented approach rather than imperative model.

TaskTimer is a program I wrote in C# in 2015 as a way to help time myself while working on programming tasks, in order to become better
att estimating the time it will take me to write code.

createBitmap.cpp contains a snippet from Avalanche's codebase regarding the construction of bitmap text reading font definitions from an XML file.

dungeonGenerator.cpp is a snippet from a roguelike I have been working on off and on which generate a dungeon using a simple procedural algorithm.

MessageDispatch.h/.cpp is a rapidly put together message dispatch system for use in a asynchronous capacity. Objects inherit from a message handler interface, which can then be registered and called upon through the message dispatcher.

Othello was a game of Reversi that I wrote back in 2010 using the SDL media API. I hesitate to call it good code as I wrote it a long time ago,
but I like to think it showcases my ability to write complete programs, from start to finish, and shows my path of improving since 2010.
The game used some rudimentary (read: not good) TCP/IP 2 player networking code using SDL's socket implementation.
