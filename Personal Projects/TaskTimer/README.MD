TaskTimer was a personal project written in 2015 as a way for me to be able to time myself doing tasks, 
in an effort to make myself better att estimating the time programming tasks take.

The project is written in C# using Microsoft Visual Studio 2013 and allows for the saving 
and loading of task projects, showing the accumulated time across the project as well as 
individual time spent on each task.
