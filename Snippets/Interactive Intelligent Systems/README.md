facial_detection.py contains a solution to an assigned task of detecting and tracking a face using OpenCV's facial detection tools.

ObjectRecognition.py and DataReader.py are exerpts from the course's final project, involving using a NAO robot to navigate a room and search for specific items.

ObjectRecognition.py performs the object-recognition task of identifying an object that is being searched for, given a set of keypoints and graphical information that is read from textfiles using DataReader.py.
